# Obsidio starter: Python + FastAPI. NAIVE ON PURPOSE.
#
# Implements the contract correctly, so it builds, runs, and passes the health
# check. But it runs a SINGLE uvicorn worker, and the /risk computation is
# CPU-bound, so it blocks and clogs /price behind it under load. It WILL fail
# the load test. Making it resilient is YOUR job.
#
# There is deliberately NO resilience machinery here: no extra workers, no
# process pool, no caching, no queueing. That is the part you build.
#
# Core-count note: your container is capped at 2 CPUs but can SEE all host
# cores. If you add uvicorn/gunicorn workers, set the count explicitly (e.g. 2);
# do not let the server auto-size from the visible core count.
